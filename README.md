## Overview

This bot was created as a successor to Gus, created and hosted by founding staff member Yan, the longstanding music bot made for the Stardew Valley Discord voice channels. This bot is a feature-complete black-box rewrite for discord.py 2.0 (initially 1.7.3) and yt-dlp.

While there's no particularly SDV-specific code involved, the assets are tailored towards the SDV theme, and the bot expects a single channel each for voice, commands, and logging.

## Configuration

A config file is not provided in the repo as it includes the Discord token for the bot. You should be able to build your own by reading the config.py file.
