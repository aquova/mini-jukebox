    "**Welcome to the Stardrop Saloon!**  <:SDVJBpuffer:1051487974551982151>\n\nThis is the dedicated disco dancefloor of the server, where you can roll a few records and share your favourite tracks in a solo music channel.\n\nJoin the <#483784296134606848> voice channel and listen to what's been queued up in chat today. Don't worry, **all users are force-muted in the voice channel**, so it's only music playing!\n\nAdd your music with the commands below and enjoy yourselves!",
    "```ansi\n\u001B[0;0;33mRules and guidelines\n```\n:one:  **All server <#980331531425959996> apply to your posts here.**\n\n:two:  **Don't play offensive music.**\nAvoid playing any music that wouldn't be acceptable if played in-person.\nThis includes politically-loaded songs as well as any particularly explicit music.\n\n:three:  **Don't abuse the jukebox to annoy others.**\nGive others a chance to share and enjoy their music.\nSpamming the queue, playing overly-long tracks, or volume/bass-boosted edits isn't considerate of others. We'll remove your tracks from the queue if you do this.\n\n:warning:  Playlists and songs that would break our rules and guidelines will be removed, and in serious cases you may either lose access to the jukebox or be banned from the server.",
